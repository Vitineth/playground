# `terrain`

This is an implementation of the [diamond-square algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm) which generates a random terrain map of a given resolution and then displays it as a graph surface using Plottly.js.

This was written a long time ago and so the comments in it may not be the highest quality but it should do the job

An example output is given below
