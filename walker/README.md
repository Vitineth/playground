# `walker`

This a path walker visualisation program. Built entirely in JS, a point walks around a grid and a map is drawn of its movements. The more times it visits a point, the large the circle drawn at that point of the grid is. As the code stands in the repo an unvisited spot is 4 times more likely to be visited than a visited spot. Additionally, the more times a point is visited, the lighter the colour is at that point. It is advised to run this with the console open as progress and some statistical information is printed there, rather than the main screen.

An example of the output is given below.
